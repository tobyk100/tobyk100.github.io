Today, all six of my French classmates and a few of the Americans went to a
memorial service for those who were killed in the terror attacks last week.
Thankfully, no one in my program was closely affected, though one of the
victims was a third cousin of a participant and all of them knew people who
were personally affected. Nonetheless, it was a shock to my classmates one of
whom told us, "It could have been me." I am glad we were able to come together
as one tribe and one people.

At the ceremony someone had a sign of the Muslim worker at the Kosher market
who saved many lives by ushering the Jewish shoppers into a meat cooler. He
then snuck out of the building and provided police with the key that allowed
them to enter and end the situation. Four Jews were left dead, including a 22
year old guy who had just returned from his Taglit-Birthright trip in Israel.
Lassana Bathily, the grocery store employee, and Ahmed Merabet, the French
Muslim police officer killed by the terrorists, show that radical Islam does
not represent a majority of Muslims. Yes, many if not a majority of Muslims do
not share our Western values including the freedom to mock religion, however
they exemplify bravery when they risk their lives for Jews and Christians.

Seeing the incredibly diverse state of Israel proves to me that Jews and
Muslims can live together in peace. Unfortunately, radical Islam is on the rise
and the World is blinded by fear and political correctness. I wonder if this
incident is a blip or a harbinger.
